Hi,

I am writing to request leave for tomorrow, November 28, 2024. My sister has arrived in Hyderabad for treatment and is unwell, so I need to pick her up from the airport.

I apologize for the short notice and any inconvenience this may cause. As I am new to the team, your understanding and support during this time mean a lot to me.

Thank you for your understanding. I truly appreciate your support and look forward to returning and contributing positively to our team.

Best regards,
Tanmay Shyamal.
